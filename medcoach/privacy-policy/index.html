  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
  the collection and use of information in relation to this
  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p>
  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
  as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
  MedCoach unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p><h1>Information Collection and Use</h1></p> <p>
  For a better experience, while using our Service, I
  may require you to provide us with certain personally
  identifiable information. The information that
  I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
</p> <!----> <p><h1>Log Data</h1></p> <p>
  I want to inform you that whenever you
  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
  I collect data and information (through third-party
  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
  configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
  the time and date of your use of the Service, and other

  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
  stored on your device's internal memory.
</p> <p>
  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
  the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
  choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
  portions of this Service.
</p> <p><h1>Service Providers</h1></p> <p>
  I may employ third-party companies and
  individuals due to the following reasons:
</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
  I want to inform users of this Service
  that these third parties have access to their Personal
  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
</p> <p><h1>Security</h1></p> <p>
  I value your trust in providing us your
  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
  guarantee its absolute security.

  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
  that these external sites are not operated by me.
  Therefore, I h1ly advise you to review the
  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
  services.

    I do not knowingly collect personally
    identifiable information from children. I 
    encourage all children to never submit any personally
    identifiable information through 
    the Application and/or Services.
    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
