description: Developed a Discord bot that pairs users for a Lichess chess game. You can upload a SwissSys html pairing file or manually pair two players. You can also set your own time control. The bot then sends each player a unique url to join the game. If you're interested in downloading the bot, contact <a href="mailto:rnaidich@stanford.edu">rnaidich@stanford.edu</a> for more information.
